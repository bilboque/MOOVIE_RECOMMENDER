The internet offers various movie databases, but many lack a strong sense of community. CineHub aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive database alongside user-driven content and discussion forums. Star Wars and other Movies Hub caters to movie enthusiasts seeking detailed information, insightful reviews, and engaging discussions about their favorite films.

We will create an IMDb and MyAnimeList hybrid.

### Project Objective:

Our primary objective is to create a user-friendly platform that serves as:

* A comprehensive database of movies and TV shows, including details like cast, crew, plot summaries, and ratings.
* A platform for users to discover new content, share reviews, and engage in discussions about movies and TV shows.
* A community hub for movie enthusiasts to connect and interact based on shared interests.

### Description of Requirements:

#### Functional Requirements:

* **Data management:** Store, search, and retrieve information like titles, genres, release dates, cast, crew, plot summaries, and ratings for movies and TV shows.
* **User management:** User registration, login, profile creation, and management.
* **Content management:** Allow users to submit, edit, and potentially moderate reviews, with varying permission levels based on user roles.
* **Search and filtering:** Enable users to search for movies and TV shows based on diverse criteria like title, genre, release date, actors, directors, and user ratings.
